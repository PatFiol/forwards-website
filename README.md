# Company website

### Description

Simple website with the characteristic of a rotating navigation.
I used a Delivery Service company as an hypothetical example.

The approach in design is based on a minimalistic layout, with plain cards containing only basic information.

The challenge was making it fully responsive and using different breakpoints.

The functionality in JavaScript is very simple and straightforward.
I learnt it from a small tutorial from Brad Traversy.
